I think this can be solved by multiple patterns. We just need to find out which one is better. I tried with few of below:
1) State pattern (To check which States such as Card validation, Pin validation, operation, printing etc)

2) Decorator pattern (We can perform multiple add ons on Account objects such as Deposit, Withdrawl, transfer etc..)

3) Chain of responsibility (For withdrawal operation where current notes needs to be calculated base don amount withdrawn..)
