A Base64 encoder starts by chunking the binary stream into groupings of six characters: 100110 111010 001011 101001. Each of these groupings translates into the numbers 38, 58, 11, and 41.

Finally, these numbers are converted to ASCII characters using the Base64 encoding table. The 6-bit values of this example translate to the ASCII sequence m6Lp.

Using the Base64 conversion table:

38 is m
58 is 6
11 is L
41 is p
